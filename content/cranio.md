### For People

“There are inherent, intelligent and unexplained forces that create and maintain the human body.” These forces, also known as the embryological formative forces, appear during conception and continue to shape us today. My job, **_through Biodynamic Cranial Sacral Therapy_** (BCST), is to listen to these forces with openness and presence; thereby allowing these dynamic forces to naturally come forth and reorganize your system to a new level of health.

**_In my practice of BCST_**, I use gentle hands-on work that honors your innate intelligence and self-healing process. My intention is not to “fix” your problems, but rather through this sensitive, hands-on listening to encourage the intrinsic health that has been obscured due to trauma, anxiety, accidents, illness, and other events from your history.

Through this deep listening to your innate health, the revitalization of your inherent healing potential comes forth allowing for long-held patterns and often belief systems to shift. My approach emphasizes reflecting the health of the system and encouraging its expression.

Because of the gentleness and sensitivity of the method and the alignment with one’s health rather than the dis-ease, I find babies, children, and animals all readily enjoy a session.

Pets often enjoy being in the cranial field absorbing the benefits as their person is receiving the work.

### For Animals

I work with dogs, cats, birds, and horses. As a fellow practitioner once said, “If it has a spine, then it's fine!”

The following conditions have shown improvement when the animal has received BCST:

- Arthritis
- Spine and neck injuries
- Lameness
- Head injuries
- Chronic joint pain
- Hip dysplasia
- Systemic disorders
- Post-surgical recovery
- Behavioral problems and emotional problems

**_Sessions with animals_** can be short as their systems are very receptive to BCST. The time taken for the session will vary depending on the priorities that are expressed by your pet's body.

The owner/primary care-giver must accompany the animal, at least to the first session. We will spend 10-15 minutes discussing the symptoms and settling your pet. We will all sit together on the ground as I work with your pet. Your pet will choose the position that he/she is comfortable with. You may hold your pet as I work if your pet is more comfortable that way. He/she may fall deeply asleep during the session. This general protocol may be modified depending on your pet's needs.
