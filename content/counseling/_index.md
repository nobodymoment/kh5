### Couples Counseling

Couple therapy is appropriate at all stages of a relationshipâ€”not just when you are having troubles. It can be used to better understand each other and head off problems, to decide whether marriage or living together is the right move at this time, to bring insight, understanding and healing to a time of crisis or general disconnect and unhappiness, or to decide whether or not to stay together.

### Individual Counseling

My approach to counseling is individualized based on the unique needs, disposition, and therapeutic goals of each client allowing for insights, transformations and a greater capacity to feel at home within yourself and more present and alive in your life.

I work with trauma, anxiety, grief and loss, depression, attachment issues, developmental wounding, and life transitions. Having trained in Sensorimotor Psychotherapy, I adhere to those principles of organicity, wholeness, non-violence, mindfulness, and relational resonance and alchemy. Together we will develop the skills to stop and mindfully listen to your body, emotions, and thoughts. [**Read more . . .**](individuals/#individual-counseling)

### Trauma Therapy

I work with everyday traumas such as car accidents, falls, surgeries, long term Covid symptoms, sporting accidents to severe or complex traumas including rapes, incest, cancer treatments, fires, war survivors, and other horrific events. I will not dive into your trauma and create more dis-regulation in your system, but rather explore ways to stabilize your experience with present day resources, some somatic exercises to help regulate your nervous system, and help you to become more present. We will gently work through the body to recapture the safety which is inherently yours, but has been obscured due to the traumatic event. [**Read more . . .**](individuals/#trauma-therapy)
