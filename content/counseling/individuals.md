### Individual Counseling

My approach to counseling is individualized based on the unique needs, disposition, and therapeutic goals of each client allowing for insights, transformations and a greater capacity to feel at home within yourself and more present and alive in your life.

The methods I use are Sensorimotor Psychotherapy, Biodynamic Cranial Sacral Therapy, Polarity Therapy, and PACT (Psychobiological Approach to Couple Therapy), all of which are grounded in the integration of contemporary neuroscience, attachment theory, somatic awareness, mindfulness, and compassion and provide a basis for working with relationships, early wounding, grief, trauma, anxiety, depression, and creating growth and general well being.

I work with trauma, anxiety, grief and loss, depression, attachment issues, developmental wounding, and life transitions. Having trained in Sensorimotor Psychotherapy, I adhere to those principles of organicity, wholeness, non-violence, mindfulness, and relational resonance and alchemy. Together we will develop the skills to stop and mindfully listen to your body, emotions, and thoughts.

I believe the answer to our deepest wounding lies within, and given the proper environment and attunement, we can become aware of our own answers. I believe that the healing power and innate brilliant intelligence is within you, and together through a resonate field, we will discover your own unique and mysterious path to healing.

My approach is to meet each client where they are without judgement, bias or preconceptions and work mindfully, kindly, and gently with the unity of body, mind and spirit.

Through an attuned relational field, you will feel heard, reflected, and often surprised at how much is already known within you.

Working with adaptive patterns that no longer serve you and understanding somatically, emotionally and cognitively where and how these maps were created, we can unpack these brilliant, though outdated strategies, thereby freeing you to be more present and alive in your life and choices.

Often due to general mis-attunement, neglect, or actual abuse in childhood, we form adaptive patterns that create limiting beliefs and manifest in ways which are not aligned with who we are today, and how we wish to live. Often the past can hijack parts of our psyche and our body and make being present painful or seemingly impossible. This can have far reaching effects on our relationships, health, work, and spiritual growth.

I do not believe in pushing against these patterns or defenses, but rather I invite you to get to know them, befriend them, and thereby find deeper levels of change through your body, emotions, and cognitive understanding.

My extensive training combined with decades of meditation practice and in depth studies of an ancient wisdom tradition create in me a unique way of perceiving and approaching the many displays of our humanity.

### Trauma Therapy

Trauma is held in the body not in the story. “The story is not where change happens, but rather it happens right here in the moment.” Therefore, when working with traumatic events we do not need to revisit all the details of the actual event, but rather contact the charge that is held in the body causing the present time disruptions. Often there is a defensive response that needed to happen but couldn’t because of the circumstances. Often there is a deeply held charge in the body’s tissues and fluids, which needs to be sequenced out of the body to completion, thus allowing the body to let down for the first time since the event, thereby allowing the Autonomic Nervous System to recalibrate and not just experience a release, which can feel good, but does not hold the same long lasting transformative benefits as an actual discharge of the held energy.

Once the nervous system has completed its discharge of the traumatic energy, your relationship to the event will be different, and the triggers stemming from the trauma will be eased or evaporated. Change the body, change the mind. Change the mind, change the body.

I work with everyday traumas such as car accidents, falls, surgeries, long term Covid symptoms, sporting accidents to severe or complex traumas including rapes, incest, cancer treatments, fires, war survivors and other horrific events. I will not dive into your trauma and create more disregulation in your system, but rather explore ways to stabilize your experience with present day resources, some somatic exercises to help regulate your nervous system, and help you to become more present. Often with trauma, the body no longer feels like a safe place, which can be accompanied by a feeling of lack of safety in general.

We will gently work through the body to recapture the safety which is inherently yours, but has been obscured due to the traumatic event.
