### Who I Am

I am a registered psychotherapist, counselor, and skilled practitioner trained in:
- Trauma resolution
- Nervous system regulation
- Mindfulness meditation
- Attachment issues
- Grief counseling
- Sensorimotor Psychotherapy
- Biodynamic Cranial Sacral Therapy
- Embryology (including working with babies and new mothers)
- Master Pilates Teacher, second generation.

I have had the wonderfully enriching experiences of being a Teaching Assistant at the Colorado School of Energy Studies, and at the Sensorimotor Psychotherapy Institute, a Meditation instructor in international month-long silent meditation retreats, and a Trainer and Presenter of the Pilates Center Certification and Master’s Program. I am also a Karunika (teacher) with Nalandabodhi International, a contemporary Buddhist organization.

I have traveled, worked, and lived in different areas of the world, including third world countries. I enjoy doing pilgrimages to holy places in Nepal and India and enjoy spending time and working there regularly. I engage in yearly solitary and group retreats to continue to know my mind and heart so I can be of benefit to others.

My extensive travel, coupled with my in-depth study of certain wisdom traditions adds a unique depth and potency to my understanding of the human condition. I bring years of experience to my clients along with a genuine passion for the study and teaching of mind-body awareness techniques.

I have a true love for animals and have trained service dogs for the handicapped. I enjoy working with clients’ animals in the room when appropriate and enjoy offering cranial sacral sessions to them.

Aside from maintaining a private therapy practice in Boulder CO, and online, I continue to enjoy teaching workshops to Pilates professionals around the world. I feel I can bring the most good to the profession and make the biggest impact in the Pilates world, by helping teachers to connect in new ways to Pilates and to their clients.

Please explore my website and contact me if you think we might be a good fit. Wishing you well on your journey.

### What I Offer

I have a unique approach to counseling due to my background and experience as an:
- Advanced Cranial Sacral practitioner,
- a Body centered therapist,
- Couples therapist, and
- a Second generation master Pilates teacher.

I combine insight, humor, playfulness and compassion in my work to best meet you and your specific individual needs. I enjoy uncovering your personal map to growth with you. I believe you hold all the wisdom you need to resolve your own issues and with the proper support, guidance and compassion—the process naturally unfolds and brings with it many unexpected gifts.

I work extensively with:
- Trauma resolution
- Nervous system regulation
- Attachment wounds
- Grief
- Healthy boundaries
- Life transitions
- General counseling

I also help couples create secure functioning in their relationship whether you are beginning a new relationship, looking to deepen in, create more safety in, and better understand an already existing relationship, or end a relationship with kindness and love.

**In a session you can expect** to be met where you are without any judgement, gain insights into your situation, learn how the body can befriend you or act against you by unwillingly drawing you into states not in accord with the present time, and how to work with that. I draw on:
- Sensorimotor Psychotherapy
- PACT couples therapy
- Biodynamic Cranial Sacral Therapy, and
- Polarity Therapy.

Sessions with individuals may involve cranial sacral and polarity therapy depending on your needs and desires. Adding cranial sacral therapy to the latter part of a session often helps you deepen into the therapeutic work previously done in the session.

Together we can explore which is best for you on any given day: a mix of body centered counseling finishing with cranial work, body centered counseling, or a simple cranial session.

I believe in working as a team with you as you actually hold the key to your own healing, I am here to facilitate that with you.
