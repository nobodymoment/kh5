### Stillness In Motion

Out of my love and deep respect for the magic of Biodynamic Cranial Sacral Therapy, I began to explore how I could bring this to Pilates teachers in a simple and direct way.  

In this workshop, I will present a taste of biodynamic cranial sacral work particularly designed for Pilates teachers.

You will learn the basic practitioner skills used in the biodynamic work to better enhance your client’s experience. Combining brief cranial work with Pilates is a magical combination for greater embodiment, depth of experience, and autonomic regulation. Without the use of tables, this workshop will teach the main practitioner skills, and a few basic cranial holds, which can be easily applied at the beginning, or end of a lesson to deepen the client’s experience.

Through exploring the relationship to the field, which is a critical component in biodynamic cranial work, an ability to let go and surrender to “Pilates doing us” will become inherent in your movement.

### A New Approach to Pilates—Pilates and the Autonomic Nervous System

After decades of teaching Pilates, mentoring professional Pilates instructors and graduating students from The Pilates Center Training Program, I came to see that something critical was missing in our work. As I grew more into working as a therapist who works with trauma and cranial sacral with clients, I began to understand the impact and weight the autonomic nervous system carries. By ignoring this aspect of the human experience in Pilates lessons, I see where and how Pilates teachers can often get stuck, over-ride certain conditions, and not be as effective with their clients, despite the brilliance of the teacher’s Pilates work.  This is especially true when it comes to clients’ recovering from accidents and illnesses.

Learn to read your client’s body and their state of being through the map of the nervous system. Some clients progress easily, and others appear to be held in the same patterns for prolonged periods of time. Often these structural imbalances are rooted in nervous system dis-regulation

Through developing a basic understanding of the three branches of the autonomic nervous system, you will learn to recognize key signs of activation: hyper and hypo arousal as well understand Steve Porgess’ theory on third branch of the nervous system: the Social Engagement System, and learn how to apply this knowledge to your lessons.  

I will help you to understand the effects of car accidents on the nervous system and the subsequent boundary ruptures. Become aware of how and where you stand as you teach, and how you partner a client may be helping or impeding their progress after an accident.

### Kathy Grant’s Early Work

This is one of my favorite Pilates workshops to present as it is so much fun to dive into Kathy Grant’s Pilates work by sharing stories, knowledge and exercises passed onto to me during my time working for Kathy at Henri Bendel.

Having studied with and assisted Kathy Grant during that early era, I experienced Kathy's work in a unique way.In this workshop I will present exercises based on my particular time with Kathy at the Bendel’s Gym, which was the ground work for her later body of work at NYU.   These will include the warm-ups from that era, Kathy Grant’s original order of exercises and warm ups for new clients, including variations on the reformer and some of the grueling, infamous rehab exercises. I’m happy to share how adaptable this work is and how the work relates to the nervous system, to rehabilitation, and to the classical Pilates method.

### The Magic of Springs

Kathy Grant directly transmitted these forgotten teachings to me and then told me to carry this work forth. One of Kathy’s real concerns regarding the growing Pilates field, was that the proper use of springs was getting lost - by teachers and by equipment manufacturers.

In this workshop we will explore this forgotten aspect of Pilates. I will help you discover how a true relationship with the springs will bring about core strength and freedom from extraneous tension.

Too often we struggle against the equipment, the challenge of the exercise and our own habitual patterns. We will look at how the improper use of springs serves to hinder us, impede our flow of the exercise, and at times, can even distort our relationship to the work and to our clients.

Through proper relationship with the springs, you will discover how to effortlessly bring forth the exercise, connect immediately into core, correct imbalances including scoliosis, and further reflect and support intrinsic health.
This connection not only deepens our relationship to Pilates, but can have far reaching effects on our relationship with ourselves and our world.

### The Forgotten Exercises

In this 3 hour workshop, I will share some of the “forgotten” or rarely taught exercises from the Bendel era of Kathy Grant’s career.

We will explore these exercises and try them on for size.  Kathy’s repertoire is not only unique, but layered with nuances, and the teaching of her work requires a depth of understanding and enormous patience, which these days, is harder and harder to relax into.

Mostly, we will be tasting the genius behind this legendary teacher and master, and see how we can incorporate some of these exercises to help clients today.
