### Mentoring Groups

I am happy to offer mentoring groups and enjoy exploration of the method as a group. It is up to the client to arrange for a group workshop; we can meet live in Boulder, or at your studio, or via Zoom.

### Private Lessons

I offer lessons to professional teachers and teachers in training. This can be done live or via Zoom.
