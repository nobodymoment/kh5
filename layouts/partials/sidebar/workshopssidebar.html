        “Kim has a lovely manner of teaching; it is non -judgemental, filled with warmth, firmness and assuredness which makes learning from her easy and fun. She really places the information in our hands allowing the student to become independent.  She is warm and approachable and shares her experience and history without airs nor ego involvement - an absolute breath of fresh air."
