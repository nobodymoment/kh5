        “I cannot say enough good things about Kim Haroche. She was absolutely instrumental in my healing! I had been in traditional cognitive behavioral therapy for years following surviving a childhood of sexual and emotional abuse. The talk therapy really helped me to name what had happened and to make sense of it intellectually but I found that I couldn't really feel better. When I hit that wall, I began searching. I reached out to a trauma organization and asked them for referrals for the most skilled and recommended somatic therapist they knew of and they gave me Kim's number. I was beginning to understand that much of the trauma I had experienced in my childhood lived in my body and that I spent a great deal of time avoiding being in my body because it was too uncomfortable to tolerate in there. Kim was amazing. She expertly navigated me towards a new connection with my body and my sensations. She helped me to see that these sensations were messages from my body and information that could be used to more fully heal. She helped me to listen to myself and love and accept myself and that has made all the difference. I wholeheartedly recommend Kim!"
