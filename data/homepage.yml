        My approach to Counseling Therapy is individualized based on the unique needs, disposition, and therapeutic goals of each client allowing for insights, transformations and a greater capacity to feel at home within yourself and
        alive and vibrant in your life. I am a registered psychotherapist working with committed couples and individuals.

        Biodynamic Cranial Sacral Therapy benefits people and their animal friends. It can regulate the nervous system and aid in major life transitions. As a long-time practitioner I regularly witness results and relief in clients.
        I have seen Cranial Sacral Therapy reach and integrate areas in need of realignment - mentally, emotionally, and physically â€” in a way that other therapies cannot.
