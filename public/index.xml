      <description>Couples counseling The method I use when working with couples and find to be brilliant, exciting and engaging is called PACT: A Psychobiological Approach to Couple Therapy®. The method, created by my teacher, Dr. Stan Tatkin, combines neuroscience, attachment theory, and the biology of human arousal “meaning the moment-to-moment ability to manage one’s energy, alertness, and readiness to engage”—namely the autonomic nervous system.&#xA;Through this combination of modalities, you will come to understand and view your partner and yourself differently.</description>

      <description>Individual Counseling My approach to counseling is individualized based on the unique needs, disposition, and therapeutic goals of each client allowing for insights, transformations and a greater capacity to feel at home within yourself and more present and alive in your life.&#xA;The methods I use are Sensorimotor Psychotherapy, Biodynamic Cranial Sacral Therapy, Polarity Therapy, and PACT (Psychobiological Approach to Couple Therapy), all of which are grounded in the integration of contemporary neuroscience, attachment theory, somatic awareness, mindfulness, and compassion and provide a basis for working with relationships, early wounding, grief, trauma, anxiety, depression, and creating growth and general well being.</description>

      <description>For People “There are inherent, intelligent and unexplained forces that create and maintain the human body.” These forces, also known as the embryological formative forces, appear during conception and continue to shape us today. My job, through Biodynamic Cranial Sacral Therapy (BCST), is to listen to these forces with openness and presence; thereby allowing these dynamic forces to naturally come forth and reorganize your system to a new level of health.</description>
